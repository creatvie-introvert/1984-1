  ## Wireframes
  To plan the structure and layout of the site, I created fow-fidelity wireframes using **Figma**. My process began with a **mobile-first design**, ensuring responsiveness and usability on smaller screeens before scaling up. I then adapted the layouts for **tablet** and finally for **laptop/desktop** viewports, making design choices that preserve visual hierachy and accessibility across all devices.

  [Mobile wireframes](docs/mobile-wf.png)

  [Tablet wireframes](docs/tablet-wf.png)

  [Laptop wireframes](docs/desktop-wf.png)

  ## Design Choices
  The design of 1984.1 was guided by the project's satirical tone and its central theme: a modern dystopia rooted in everyday London. Each visual choice - from colours and typography to layout and imagery - was made to reinforce the atmosphere of institutional control, passive surveillance, and curated obedience, while ensuring readability and responsiveness across all devices.

  During the development, some initial design elements - particularly images - were changed to better align with the final tone and layout of the site. These updated visuals more effectively support the storytelling and aesthetic goals of the project.

  This section reflects the design decisions currently implemented on the live site and may contiue to evolve through user feedback and ongoing post-launch improvements.

  ### Typography
  **Headings - *Unioca One*** 

  Chosen for its bold, rigid style that echoes the cisual tone of public notices, government signage, and institutional messageing. It reinforces the satirical undertone by mimicking the cold authority of bureaucratic communication.

  **Body Text - *Inter***

  Selected for its clean, modern readability, modern design, and clean geometry. Inter supports the site's long-form content and adapts well across screen sizes, maintaining clarity without visual clutter.

  **Purpose & Performance**

  The combination of Unica One and Inter reflecrs the visual language of public sector materials, aligning with the site's parodty of controlled communication. To ensure performance and reduce load times, fonts are imported using `@import` from \Google Fonts.

  ![Typography Styles](docs/typography.png)

  #### Font Usage Table
  |CSS Name|Font Name|Use Case Description|
  |--------|---------|--------------------|
  |--font-body|Inter|Used for paragraphs, buttons, forms, and navigation links to ensure clarity and consistency.|
  |--font-heading|Unica One|Used for all main headings to evoke insitutional/public signage.|

  ### Colour Scheme
  A limited 5-colour palette was used to create a stark, modernist aesthetic. The colours were chosen to reflect both the physical urban environment of London and the emotional tone of passive control. I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to explore combinations and define a cohesive colour palette.

  ![Colour Scheme](docs/1984-1-colours.png)

  |CSS Variable|Hex Code|Usage Description|
  |------------|--------|-----------------|
  |`--page-bg` |`1E1E1E`  |Background colour of the page|
  |`--primary-text`|`EAEAEA`|Default body text colour|
  |`--cta-text`|`000000`  |Call-to-action text colour; used in buttons and highlighted UI elements|
  |`--link-text`|`5FAFFF` |Standard link colour|
  |`--alerts`|`CF382A` |Used for warning or error messages and helper text|
  |`--ctas-highlight`|`FFDD2D`|Button background, highlight accents, and hover states for interactive elements|

  ### Responsiveness
  To ensure the site worked effectively across all devices, I followed a **mobile-first approach**, starting with wireframes for small screens and scaling up to tablet and desktop.

  I used **Relume's layout library for inspiration** for designing my wireframes. All layouts were custom built and adapted to fit the tone, content, and style of 1984.1

  ### Images
  The imagery in 1984.1 plays a critical role in reinforcing the site's satirical tone and dystopian message. All images were selected or generated to resemble propaganda posters, government-issued warnings, and comic-style artwork that exaggerates modern anxieties.

  **Design Intent**:
  - **Style**: Stylised, high-contrast illustrations with bold lines and muted or limited colour palettes to evoke feelings of control, surveillance, and psychological strain.
  - **Themes**: Each image aligns with a core theme - such as housing inequality, social isolation, or mass surveillance - and often includes exaggerated or surreal elements to heightn the satire.
  - **Accessibility**: All images include descriptive `alt` text that communicates both the visual content and the satirical intent for screen reader users.
  - **Optimisation**: Images are served in .webp format to balance visual quality and performance, keeping load times minimal across devices.

  This approach ensures the visual content doesn't just decorate the site - it deepens the narrative and experience.

## Features
The **1984.2** website includes a range of features designed to support its satirical tone, reinforce its dystopian narrative, and ensure accessibility across all devices. Each section was deliberately styled to reflect the aesthetic of institutional messaging, urban surveillance, and controlled user experience.

### Responsive Layout

### Hero Section
The hero section serves as the site's bold introduction, immediately establishing its satirical tone and dystopian theme. It features a prominent, multi-line heading with a subheading styled as a smaller `<small>` tag, delivering dark humour through phases like *"Now With Targeted Ads!"* Below this, a lead paragraph reinforces the parody with references to modern surveillance culture, setting the stage for the site's narrative. A clear call-to-action button (*"Welcome to London"*) is places beneath the text, styled as a large Bootstrap button that spans the full-width on smaller screens `w-100` and adjusts to auto width on larger ones `w-md-auto` for responsiveness and accessibility. Structurally, the section is built using Bootstrap's grid system: a singlerow aligns the content vertically on mobile and transitions to a two-column ;ayout on larger viewports `col-12` and `col-ld-6`. The right-hand column contains an optimised `.img-fluid` image of a comic-style illustration of London's skyline, in .webp format for responsiveness and performance. The entire hero section is enclosed in a `<header>` element with `bg-dark` and `text-light` classes for high contrast, along with `py-5` padding and `section` for spacing and structural consistency.

The layout is powered by Flexbox for vertical centring, with structured paragraphs and a stylised heading that escalates in tone toward a strong closing alignment statement. Responsive padding and alignment ensure readability across screen sizes, while `aria-label` enhances accessibility for screen readers. The section maintains consistency with the site's visual language, using sematic HTML and typographics cohesion to deliver a memorable, legible, and technically sound introduction.

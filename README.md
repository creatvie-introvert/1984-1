It guides users through themes such as surveillance, propaganda, and thought control using humour, visual design and interactive storytelling.

  ## Wireframes
  To plan the structure and layout of the site, I created fow-fidelity wireframes using **Figma**. My process began with a **mobile-first design**, ensuring responsiveness and usability on smaller screeens before scaling up. I then adapted the layouts for **tablet** and finally for **laptop/desktop** viewports, making design choices that preserve visual hierachy and accessibility across all devices.

  ## Design Choices
  The design 1984.1 was guided by the project's satirica tone and its central theme: a modern dystopia rooted in everyday London. Each visual choice - from colours and typography to layout and imagery - was made to reinforce the atmosphere of institutional control, passive surveillance, and curated obedience, while ensuring readability and responsive ness across aall devices.

  These choices reflect the design intent at the start of development and may be refined further based on how they perform on the live site.

  ### Typography
  **Headings:** Unioca One - chosen for its rigid, institutiona;l feel
  **Body Text:** Inter - clean, modern, and supports long critical copy

  The typography choices made are to evoke state-issued documents and public sector websites.

  ### Colour SCheme
  A limited 5-colour palette was used to create a stark, modernist aesthetic. The colours were chosen to reflect both the physical urban environment of London and the emotional tone of passive control.

  ### Responsiveness
  To ensure the site worked effectively across all devices, I followed a **mobile-first approach**, starting with wireframes for small screens and scaling up to tablet and desktop.

  I used **Relume's layout library for inspiration** for designing my wireframes. All layouts were custom built and adapted to fit the tone, content, and style of 1984.1
